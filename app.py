## üíº About Me

Hello! I'm **Deepak Prasad Shah**, currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at **Chandigarh University**. Beyond just academics and technical skills, I believe in the power of leadership, communication, and teamwork ‚Äî values that have shaped me into who I am today.

### üèÜ Leadership Journey

My leadership journey took off during my **12th grade**, when I was honored to serve as the **House Leader**. With determination, team spirit, and clear communication, I led my house to become the **Best House of the Year** ‚Äî an achievement that still fills me with pride. That experience taught me how to **motivate a team**, set shared goals, and adapt under pressure ‚Äî lessons I carry with me even today.

At Chandigarh University, I‚Äôve continued to grow as a leader. As an active member of **CUNSS (Chandigarh University Nepali Students Society)**, I successfully **organized two major events**, coordinating with multiple teams and managing everything from planning to execution. These opportunities have deepened my sense of **responsibility** and **social commitment**.

### ü§ù People & Team Skills

I'm someone who **connects easily with people**, no matter their background. Whether I‚Äôm collaborating on a group project, managing an event, or just helping a peer, I value clear communication, mutual respect, and genuine engagement.

I‚Äôm often told I‚Äôm the kind of person who **brings people together** and keeps the energy positive. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I enjoy **teamwork and coordination** ‚Äî because when a group works in sync, great things happen.

## üå± Looking Ahead

I'm excited to continue growing as a responsible leader and a tech enthusiast. Whether it's through developing innovative tech solutions or organizing impactful social events, I strive to make a meaningful contribution ‚Äî both in my community and in the world of technology.

## üéì Education

### üìò Class 10 ‚Äî Modern Indian School, Chovar, Kathmandu  
I completed my Class 10 from **Modern Indian School**, Chovar, Kathmandu, with a score of **90.6%**. This phase built a solid academic base for me and nurtured my interest in science and technology. It was during these years that I developed a structured way of thinking and a deep curiosity about how things work.

### üìó Class 11 & 12 ‚Äî Kendriya Vidyalaya, Embassy of India, Kathmandu  
I pursued my higher secondary education at **Kendriya Vidyalaya, Embassy of India, Kathmandu**, and secured **85%** in Class 12. These years were transformative ‚Äî I was selected as the **House Leader** and led my house to win the **Best House Award**. I also had the opportunity to organize **two major events under CUNSS**, which helped me gain real experience in planning, communication, and teamwork.

However, this phase also came with challenges. Despite **Chemistry** being one of my favorite subjects, I struggled with it in 11th grade. Until then, I had rarely faced failure ‚Äî so this was a moment of personal growth. It taught me how to **deal with setbacks**, **bounce back**, and develop resilience. That experience made me stronger and more self-aware, both academically and emotionally.

### üéì Bachelor's ‚Äî Chandigarh University  
Currently, I‚Äôm pursuing my **Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science and Engineering** at **Chandigarh University**. My time here has been dynamic and full of exploration ‚Äî I've made valuable connections, worked on exciting projects, and discovered new areas of interest.

I've applied for **four patents** as part of my innovation journey:
- A **fully automated anti-drone system** operating in the 2.4GHz band  
- A **MOSFET-type suggestion mechanism**  
- A **solar panel cleaning device**  
- A **mechanical lifting mechanism**

These projects reflect my strong grip over **electronics, electrical systems**, and even **mechanical concepts**. I love bridging hardware with software to solve real-world problems creatively and efficiently.
